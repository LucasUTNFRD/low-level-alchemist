# implementation of a compiler following the boook Crafting interpreters

### currently working on lexing:
### lexer MVP:
* open a .lox file and tokenize it
* for tokenization i need to scan char by char and create token outputs

### things to work:
~~* Read source from a file and then scann it
* improve recongition of keywords and lexemes
  * improve this with a hashmap or a big switch case.
